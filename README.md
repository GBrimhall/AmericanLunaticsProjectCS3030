Create a customer report using a few pyhton modules and then FTP the file to a "customer" server. This takes two input parameters (beg_date, end_date). These two parameters, which are needed to query your database, are being input with the following format: YYYYMMDD. With this information, you will query your DB to retrieve the transaction information needed for your report.

Create a shell wrapper script that will call your create_report.py module.
